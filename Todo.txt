Since my //Todo does not show up on Github this does not need a // and just is a txt file

----------Bugs-------------------
Make sure currency is rounded down and costs rounded up
Combat XP from martial arts
Combat regen from dr 
Make sure combat exits after 50 rounds
Add good earn


----------UI---------------------
Scroll divs rather than page
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/making-a-div-vertically-scrollable-using-css/

When you change tabs remember the last scroll position of that tab.
A page to show some stats about the game. ie how many rebirths.
Add somewhere to see multipliers for skills/Jobs
If net income is negative, show years till bankruptcy
It would be nice if, instead of just a skip checkbox on skills, you could input a max level, so you can easierly plan to powerlevel some skills
If possible,  making the sidebar (that displays the players age and income) be something like  position: fixed; top: #px; left: #px; z-index: # (where # is whatever number looks right).  The top tabs as well. This removes the elements from the normal document flow, (it makes them "stick in place" when the user scrolls). This way when the player scrolls down that important information will always be viewable. (The other elements will have to have some sort of margin-top and margin-left to space out correctly and not overlap the fixed elements).
Replace XP left with progress


----------Features---------------
Add job categories: Academic, Medical and Criminal. 
    Medical unlocks only for good heroes, criminal for bad 
    Add more jobs + skills with unlocks related to good/evil  

Add offline / paused time that can be spend on speeding up the game

Add FAQ + multiplier breakdown
    Many people don't understand the max level calculation.

Add age mechanic 
    - multiplier (<1) to physical after age 35
    - multiplier (<1) to physical after mental 50
    - add stuff to delay start
    
Saving

----------Maintenance------------
Split code over more useful categories (main.js and UI update is getting a bit long)
Move all colours to CSS
    Pick RG or hex format for colours
    Better colours. Esp for light mode

Change headers to classes with colours set in CSS
Clean up CSS!
    remove the w3 crap
----------Uncategorised----------

For me, something like four different buttons to switch between Jobs, Skills, Shop, and Amulet would be brilliant. I'd probably prefer 1234 or QWER. Maybe ESC or S to open settings, and to finish P for toggle auto-promote and L for auto-learn. Those are just my personal suggestions.
Space for pausing or something like that obviously wouldn't hurt, I just wanted to point out that I have never paused the game (I didn't even know it was possible to pause until you said it).


Host: https://pages.github.com/
    go to folder project
    run 
    
    git clone https://github.com/The-Woodchuck/The-Woodchuck.github.io
    cd the-woodchuck.github.io
    git add --all
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin main

Automation tab
    Auto pause: on new job /skill unlocks
    Make auto-learn use exp/day and remaining to work out what to level next.
    Add a filter to turn on and off skills to learn.
    A more complex auto-learn that lets you give detailed instructions on what level you want each skill and in what order.
        ie "Train Productivity to 50" -> "Train Meditation to 50" -> "Train Productivity to 100" -> "Train Strength to 100" etc


Add villain fight mechanic
    On win: Absorb superpower
    Player can choose: kill (get evil point), imprison (get good point), let go (no points, but can absorb again)
    Kill/imprison. Spawn new villain of same tier, but 10% stronger. Receive if (villain tier) hero points for first kill of that tier
    
    if first win in Tier 2 prestige, add hero points

Add tier 2 prestige 
    reset tiers to allow more hero points

Add hero points to be spent

Add combat simulator on first death
Add FAQ with unlocks as you unlock more mechanics
Add achievements
Add housing, items and Armory
Add weaponsmiths (hired inventors that upgrade armory items)
Armory items: hat, shirt, pants, shoes, gloves, weapon
    Choose bonus per item (e.g. hat boost int)
    Weaponsmith has chance to increase random item per day.
    Weaponsmiths are expensive - ideally goes along the "rich" superpower
Minigames:
    Sudoku solver. Provides Int exp. At high int, start unlocking Automation
    Something for strength?

     
I poked around briefly in main.js and adjusted the behavior of Auto-learn to my liking. Posting it here in case anyone else wants to do the same (just replace the current calculation of xpDict[skill.name] in setSkillWithLowestMaxXp() with this)

daysToNextLevel = skill.getMaxXp() / skill.getXpGain()
nextLevelRelativeValue = skill.baseData.effect / skill.getEffect()
if (skill.name == "Bargaining") {
    // Hack to treat Bargaining like a normal skill
    nextLevelRelativeValue = .01 / (1 + .01*skill.level)
}
xpDict[skill.name] = daysToNextLevel / nextLevelRelativeValue

This takes the time to train the next level and the marginal value of the next level into account
